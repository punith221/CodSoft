          <h2>Wright Flyer</h2>
          <p>The machine that made the first successful flight in a heavier-than-air powered aircraft may be the most important airplane of all time. But don't forget: the Wright Brothers achieved an unprecedented level of airmanship—and marketing—that went far beyond those first few minutes aloft on the beaches of Kitty Hawk.</p>

          <h2>Supermarine Spitfire</h2>
          <p>The Spitfire was the only British fighter in continuous production throughout the entire Second World War. It became the backbone of the Royal Air Force Fighter Command and was most noted for beating back the German Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain. The distinct elliptical wings were designed to have the thinnest possible cross section, which resulted in higher speeds than many other fighters of the day.        </p>

          <h2>Learjet 23</h2>
          <p>TBack in 1960, Bill Lear moved to Switzerland from his home in California to form the Swiss American Aviation Corporation, with the intention of redesigning the FFA P-16 ground attack fighter prototype. It failed, and Switzerland eventually cancelled its order for the SAAC-23 ExecutJet. But that didn't deter Lear, who built on its potential and moved back to the U.S. to manufacture his own executive version.</p>
